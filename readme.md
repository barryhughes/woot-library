Woot Library
============

A simple WordPress plugin that delivers a number of helper functions for those folks building sites and selling tickets
using a trio of:

* The Events Calendar
* WooCommerce Tickets
* WooCommerce

It is packaged as a plugin and must be installed and activated before the helper functions can be used. The advantage
of the plugin approach (as opposed to embedding the functions in your theme's functions.php file for instance - though
you are of course welcome to do so if you wish) is that if a problem is found and fixed, or new helpers are added,
you need only update the latest version of the plugin to benefit.
