Woot Library
============

> As of The Events Calendar's 3.8 release, this plugin is obsolete! Please use the API functions/template tags
> bundled with that plugin instead of this library.

A simple WordPress plugin that delivers a number of helper functions for those folks building sites and selling tickets
using a trio of:

* The Events Calendar
* WooCommerce Tickets
* WooCommerce

It is [packaged as a plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woot-library/) and must be installed and activated before the
helper functions can be used. The advantage of the plugin approach (as opposed to embedding the functions in your
theme's functions.php file for instance - though you are of course welcome to do so if you wish) is that if a problem is
found and fixed, or new helpers are added, you need only update the latest version of the plugin to benefit.

Grab a copy
-----------

You can obtain this [from the WordPress plugin directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woot-library/) -(recommended,
since that will facilitate automated updates) or else download a release zip here on the GitHub repo.- however if you
are using an up-to-date copy of The Events Calendar *this plugin is no longer required and I advise you do not use it.*
