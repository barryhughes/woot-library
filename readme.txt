Tools to help you customize your WooCommerce Tickets experience.

== Description ==

[WooCommerce Tickets](http://tri.be/shop/wordpress-wootickets/) builds on
[The Events Calendar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) and
[WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) itself to help people sell tickets for events via their
WordPress powered website. Woot Library provides a number of helpers to make it easier to build various types of
customization, such as (but not limited to!):

* Placing the event title in the shopping cart
* Pulling event details into catalog views

Dramatic, eh?

== Installation ==

1. Install it like any other plugin!
2. Activate
3. The library will now be available for use

== Screenshots ==

No screenshots, sorry! This plugin is merely a library of functions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

By itself, nothing. It simply provides a number of "helpers" to let people selling tickets with WooCommerce Tickets
build customizations just a little more easily than is normally possible.

= How can I request a new helper? =

Post on the forum.

= Why "Woot" in "Woot Library"? =

WooCommerce Tickets was originally named WooTickets and so I contracted that to WooT, softened the last letter and felt
all smug and satisfied with the result.
